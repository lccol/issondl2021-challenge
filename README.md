# ISSonDL2021 - Waste Classification Challenge
This repository contains my solution (2nd place) for the Waste Classification challenge, held within the context of International Summer School on Deep Learning (ISSonDL2021).

The solution consists of two Jupyter Notebooks:
- `ISSonDL2021_challenge_resnet.ipynb`, containing the code for the 1st round. Here, pre-trained ResNet model was used;
- `ISSonDL2021_challenge_densenet.ipynb`, containing the code for the 2nd round. Here, a pre-trained DenseNet model was used;

All the neural networks are implemented with PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning.
The models were trained on Google Colab (GPU runtime).
